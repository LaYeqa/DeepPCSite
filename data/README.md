# Downloading the sc-PDB Database as Mol2 Files
- Go to this website: http://bioinfo-pharma.u-strasbg.fr/scPDB/RESULTS
- There should be search results for over 16,000 proteins (1600+ pages if there are 10 proteins per page).
- In the top right corner, click EXPORT and under MOLECULAR STRUCTURES, click SITES. The file should begin to download.
- Move the downloaded file into the DeepPCSite/scpdb directory for full functionality.

The total download may take some time as the mol2 file along is nearly 15GB in size.
